## üíª Technologies Used

üöΩ ToiletGoWhere is built using the following technologies:

- React: A JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
- React Router: Used to enable client-side routing.
- Google Maps API: Used for displaying maps, markers, and providing location-based services.
- Firebase Authentication: Handles user authentication and account management.
- Geolib: Library that provides basic geospatial operation.
- Material UI: Offers a comprehensive suite of UI tools.

## üìö What we learnt

- To build a React app with functional components.
- To apply React Router to enable client-side router. We used the useParams function to allow Web Page information (i.e. Reviews for a specified toilet, the navbar button that was clicked) to persist even after the user refreshes the page.
- To leverage Google Maps and Places API in our app to provide real-time navigational features and location suggestions to users.
- To use Firebase products such as Realtime Database and Storage to build the backend. We also used Firebase Authentication to provide user identity for our app. The user identity is used to associate the users liked toilets and reviews with the users.
- To use Material UI's components to build a beautiful app. We used icons to further highlight what each of our app components does or shows.
- To leverage third-party libraries like Geolib to perform geospatial computation. We used Geolib's orderByDistance function to sort the nearest toilets to the user's or searched location by coordinates.
